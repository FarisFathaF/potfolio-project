                            <p>Congratulations on stumbling upon my web! let me introduce myself to you, my name is Faris
                              Fatha Fallahian, I am a Fresh Graduate of Electrical Engineering at Universitas Islam Indonesia
                              (or as people call it UII). I have a strong passion about automation and control systems, energy, and programming.

                              I am currently learning web development by actively applying it in real projects, 
                              such as this website that you're visiting right now, to improve my programming skills. So far, I’ve 
                              found web development to be so much fun! I’m excited to see what I can create next as I continue to improve.
